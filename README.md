# teatalk
A small nuxt app which helps with having nice conversations with people during a tea/coffee break or at other time. The app shows a question which you can ask to someone, or answer yourself. Don't like the question? Go to the next one. With over 300 questions there is always something to talk about. You can also mark a question as favorite so you can easily find it again.

The app can be found here: https://teatalk.netlify.app/
